\section{References}
\label{sec:References}

References should be made using Bib\TeX~\cite{BibTeX}. A special style
\texttt{LHCb.bst} has been created to achieve a uniform
style. Independent of the journal the paper is submitted to, the
preprint should be created using this style. Where arXiv numbers
exist, these should be added even for published articles. In the PDF
file, hyperlinks will be created to both the arXiv and the published
version.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Citations are marked using square brackets, and the
  corresponding references should be typeset using Bib\TeX\ and the
  official \lhcb Bib\TeX\ style. An example is in
  Ref.~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za}.

\item For references with four or less authors all of the authors'
  names are listed~\cite{Weinberg:1967}, otherwise the first author
  is given, followed by \etal. The \lhcb Bib\TeX\ style will
  take care of this. The limit of four names can be changed by changing the number 4 in 
  ``{\tt \#4 'max.num.names.before.forced.et.al :=}''
  in {\tt LHCb.bst}, as was done in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2017-038}.

\item The order of references should be sequential when reading the
  document. This is automatic when using Bib\TeX.

\item The titles of papers should in general be included. To remove
  them, change \texttt{\textbackslash
    setboolean\{articletitles\}\{false\}} to \texttt{true} at the top
  of this template.
  Note that the titles in \verb!LHCb-PAPER.bib! are in plain LaTex,
  in order to correspond to the actual title on the arXiv record.
  Some differences in style can thus be noticed with respect to the
  main text, for example particle names that use capital Greek letters
  are not slanted in the reference titles ($\Lambda$ vs \Lz)  

\item Whenever possible, use references from the supplied files
\verb!main.bib!, \verb!LHCb-PAPER.bib!, \verb!LHCb-CONF.bib!, and \verb!LHCB-DP.bib!.
These are kept up-to-date by the EB. If you see a mistake, do not edit these files,
but let the EB know. This way, for every update of the paper, you save
yourself the work of updating the references. Instead, you can just copy or
check in the latest versions of the \verb!.bib! files from the repository.   

\item For those references not provided by the EB, the best
  is to copy the Bib\TeX\ entry directly from
  \texttt{Inspire}. Often these need to be edited to get the 
  correct title, author names and formatting. 
  For authors with multiple initials, add a space between them (change \texttt{R.G.C.} to \texttt{R. G. C.}),
  otherwise only the first initial will be taken. 
  Also, make sure to eliminate unnecessary capitalisation.
  Apart from that, the title should be respected as much as possible
  (\eg do not change particle names to PDG convention nor introduce/remove factors of $c$).
  Check that both the arXiv and the journal index are clickable
  and point to the right article.

%\item Even if the basic formatting of the Bib\TeX\ entry is taken from
%  \texttt{Inspire}, all the data should be cross checked against the
%  journal. Often there are minor changes to author initials or
%  titles. In case of a difference between the preprint and the
%  journal, the bibliographic information from the journal should be
%  used.

\item The \texttt{mciteplus}~\cite{mciteplus} package is used
  to enable multiple references to show up as a single item in the
  reference list. As an example \texttt{\textbackslash
    cite\{Cabibbo:1963yz,*Kobayashi:1973fv\}} where the \texttt{*}
  indicates that the reference should be merged with the previous
  one. The result of this can be seen in
  Ref.~\cite{Cabibbo:1963yz,*Kobayashi:1973fv}. Be aware that the
  \texttt{mciteplus} package should be included as the very last item
  before the \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}} to work
  correctly.

\item It should be avoided to make references to public notes and
  conference reports in public documents. Exceptions can be discussed
  on a case-by-case basis with the review committee for the
  analysis. In internal reports they are of course welcome and can be
  referenced as seen in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-CONF-2011-003} using the
  \texttt{lhcbreport} category. For conference reports, omit the
  author field completely in the Bib\TeX\ record.

\item To get the typesetting and hyperlinks correct for \lhcb reports,
  the category \texttt{lhcbreport} should be used in the Bib\TeX\
  file. See Refs.~\cite{LHCb-INT-2011-047, *LHCb-ANA-2011-078,
    *CERN-THESIS-2014-057, *LHCb-PROC-2014-017, *LHCB-TALK-2014-257}
  for some examples. It can be used for \lhcb documents in the series
  \texttt{CONF}, \texttt{PAPER}, \texttt{PROC}, \texttt{THESIS},
  \texttt{LHCC}, \texttt{TDR} and internal \lhcb reports. Papers sent
  for publication, but not published yet, should be referred with
  their \texttt{arXiv} number, so the \texttt{PAPER} category should
  only be used in the rare case of a forward reference to a paper.

\item Proceedings can be used for references to items such as the
  \lhcb simulation~\cite{LHCb-PROC-2011-006}, where we do not yet have
  a published paper.

\end{enumerate}

There is a set of standard references to be used in \lhcb that are
listed in Appendix~\ref{sec:StandardReferences}.
